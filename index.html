				    We are Students from the University of Colorado Boulder. Throughout Our studys in High Preformance Computing we found that resources in learning about HPC are limited or Dated. We hope that this website will serve as a resource for people to learn about how to build test 
				and run there own cluster off of the Raspberry Pi Computer. 
				We Have Borken down the work into four different Sections to Help People Learn about High Preformance Computing
				<br><br><b>How To: Learn How to Build your own cluster
				<br><br>Tests: Look at the preformace Tests
				<br><br>Education: Learn about High Preformance Computing and Our System</b>

				WHY PI?
			</h1>
			<p>
				One of the Best Ways to understand how parralelization works is to build your own. Through building your own you will learn so much more.<br><br>Now you may be thinking to yourself that since a cluster is deviced of basically connecting a bunch of computers together that the cost of building on of these clusters would be exorbitant. Since we were not worried about making a cluster that has a great sum of power, we can use really small, low powered and cheap computers. The perfect tool for this is the Raspberry Pi Computer. 
				<br><br>The Raspberry PI computer was a computer developed in 2006 when a group from the University of Cambridge become concerened with the lack of computer skills that A students had. Before in the 90's they were finding that many students and kids where coming into school as experianced computer hobist. Now since a computer was no longer considered a toy, but thought of as an escentail tool for the family there is becoming an increasing lack and knowledge of computers. This motto and goal fits exactly with what we are trying to do, LEARN ABOUT HIGH PREFORMANCE COMPUTING!
