  				<h1>CLUSTER</h1>
  				<p>A computer cluster consists of a set of loosely connected or tightly connected computers that work together so that in many respects they can be viewed as a single system.(from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster"> Wikipedia</a>)<br><br> A cluster can be thought of as hooking together computers with some sort of network cable to enable them to run some problems faster. A lot of the time when computing large data sets it makes more sense for data to be ran on more than just one computer. In this case there is the cluster.</p>

  			<h1>BENCHMARK</h1>
  			<p>Benchmarking is the process of comparing one's business processes and performance metrics to industry bests or best practices from other industries. Dimensions typically measured are quality, time and cost. In the process of best practice benchmarking, management identifies the best firms in their industry, or in another industry where similar processes exist, and compares the results and processes of those studied (the "targets") to one's own results and processes. In this way, they learn how well the targets perform and, more importantly, the business processes that explain why these firms are successful.

Benchmarking is used to measure performance using a specific indicator (cost per unit of measure, productivity per unit of measure, cycle time of x per unit of measure or defects per unit of measure) resulting in a metric of performance that is then compared to others.[1][2]

Also referred to as "best practice benchmarking" or "process benchmarking", this process is used in management and particularly strategic management, in which organizations evaluate various aspects of their processes in relation to best practice companies' processes, usually within a peer group defined for the purposes of comparison. This then allows organizations to develop plans on how to make improvements or adapt specific best practices, usually with the aim of increasing some aspect of performance. Benchmarking may be a one-off event, but is often treated as a continuous process in which organizations continually seek to improve their practices.(from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking"> Wikipedia</a>>)</p>

  			<h1>MPI</h1>
  			<p>Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed by a group of researchers from academia and industry to function on a wide variety of parallel computers. The standard defines the syntax and semantics of a core of library routines useful to a wide range of users writing portable message-passing programs in Fortran or the C programming language. There are several well-tested and efficient implementations of MPI, including some that are free or in the public domain. These fostered the development of a parallel software industry, and there encouraged development of portable and scalable large-scale parallel applications.(from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

  			<h1>OPEN_MP</h1>
  			<p>OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is an API that supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran,[4] on most processor architectures and operating systems, including Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows platforms. It consists of a set of compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables that influence run-time behavior(from Wikipedia<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP"></a>)</p>

  			<h1>SERIAL CODE</h1>
  			<p>In telecommunication and computer science, serial communication is the process of sending data one bit at a time, sequentially, over a communication channel or computer bus. This is in contrast to parallel communication, where several bits are sent as a whole, on a link with several parallel channels.

Serial communication is used for all long-haul communication and most computer networks, where the cost of cable and synchronization difficulties make parallel communication impractical. Serial computer buses are becoming more common even at shorter distances, as improved signal integrity and transmission speeds in newer serial technologies have begun to outweigh the parallel bus's advantage of simplicity (no need for serializer and deserializer, or SerDes) and to outstrip its disadvantages (clock skew, interconnect density). The migration from PCI to PCI Express is an example.(from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication"> Wikipedia</a>)</p>

  			<h1>CPU</h1>
  			<p>A central processing unit (CPU), also referred to as a central processor unit,[1] is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of the system. The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s.[2] The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains much the same.(from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

  			<h1>GPU</h1>
  			<p>A graphics processing unit (GPU), also occasionally called visual processing unit (VPU), is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics, and their highly parallel structure makes them more effective than general-purpose CPUs for algorithms where processing of large blocks of data is done in parallel. In a personal computer, a GPU can be present on a video card, or it can be on the motherboard or—in certain CPUs—on the CPU die.[1](from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
